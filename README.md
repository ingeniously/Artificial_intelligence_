# Diabetes Prediction Using ANN 

## Motivation

* Diabetes is a chronic medical condition which is estimated to affect 415
million people in the world.
* 5 million deaths a year can be attributed to diabetes-related complications.
* Type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed if diagnosed early.


**So, why not using machine learning to predict  diabetes in patients
using vital statistics by using datasets where patients have been diagnosed. By training a neural network, we can use it to make predic-
tions on new patients**

## Problem Statement
Then we decided to use an other approach of the problem:
* Use a Convolutional neural Network to try to increse the accuracy for more
important datasets about diagnoscticed persons
* Moreover we   build a useful interface to permet real test for newpatients. Our main goal is to increase the precison by training the model and
make this useful for medical purpose thanks to the user interface.
