\section*{Abstract}
Neural nets take inspiration from the learning process occurring in human brains. They consists of an artificial network of functions, called parameters, which allows the computer to learn, and to fine tune itself, by analyzing new data
\\
Neural networks are also able to handle large amounts of data and can learn from data without being explicitly programmed with a set of rules or a decision tree. This allows them to be very flexible and adaptable, and makes them well-suited for tasks that are difficult to define using traditional programming techniques.
